## Feeder - simple news feed app

Feeder was a take-home interview project designed to test code craftsmanship, playful UI/UX design and maintainability of the code.

### The Ask
Create an app that meets the following criteria:
* **View a list** of the given news articles
- **View only favorite** news articles
- **Open an article** on the web
- **Mark favorite articles** for quick access later
* Is **delightful, intuitive and maintainable**
* Do it all in **4-8 hours total**

### No Nos
* Using Interface Builder (all UI mist be done in code)
* Making web calls
* Only using native frameworks (use whatever gets the job done)
